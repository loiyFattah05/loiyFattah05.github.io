            <p><strong>Personal Statement:</strong> A fellow immigrant trying to live the “American dream.” I moved here in 2020 — and the rest is history. 
            I’m a Computer Science major concentrating in Cyber Security, hoping I don’t end up homeless 😂. 
            I love going to the fields to play Futball with friends and joining tournaments with them.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I was born and raised almost my entire life in Jordan, a small country in the Middle East. 
            I speak Arabic fluently and my English is pretty good too! My family and I moved to Charlotte, NC in 2020 to be near our family 
            and have been here ever since.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I started working when I was 16 helping my dad at his factory during the summer. 
            Later, I worked at Target for two and a half years, and now I’m working at Domino’s — but I’m looking for something new soon!</p>
        
            <p><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I’m a junior majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Cyber Security at UNC Charlotte.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Courses I’m Taking & Why:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>CJUS-1511:</strong> Local Social Science — Easy elective class to fill in credits</li>
                <li><strong>ITIS-3135:</strong> Front-End Web App Development — Required in my concentration</li>
                <li><strong>ITSC-3146:</strong> Operating Systems & Networking — Required in my major</li>
                <li><strong>ITSC-3688:</strong> Computers and Their Impact on Society — Suggested by my advisor</li>
                <li><strong>STAT-2122:</strong> Intro to Probability and Statistics — Required in my major</li>
            </ol>
        
            <p><strong>Funny / Interesting Fact:</strong> When I was younger, I thought the hazard button in a car meant 
            it would split in half since both turn signals would flash 😂.</p>

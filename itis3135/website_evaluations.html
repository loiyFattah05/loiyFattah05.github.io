            <h2><a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a> — Good Example</h2>
            <p>Apple’s website Follows the CRAP principles very carefully. Very clean website and very easy to
                navigate/reach the desired destination/product.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Excellent — Big images against black or white backgrounds. This
                    combination makes everything pop.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent layout, fonts, and buttons. Everything mstches perfectly.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Everything is lined up, text, images, and buttons all float clean
                    sections.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> All related things are grouped together with lots of space to be able to
                    clearly distinguish between products/services..</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2><a href="https://www.paradisewater.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paradise Drinking Water</a> —
                Bad Example</h2>
            <p>This site is horrible website regarding the CRAP principles. It still works, but horrible.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Alot of blue on white blocks. Alot of different blocks all over the
                    screen making really nothing stand out.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Different fonts in each part of the screen. Different heading all over
                    the screen going for h1 to h3 back to h2 and so on.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The page looks like a stcaked flyer, images, lists,and subheads all sit
                    on different axes..</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> None of the related stuff are grouped together. The page is a bunch of
                    random blocks. Ex. An introduction has a promo right next to it which doesn't make sense</li>
            </ul>

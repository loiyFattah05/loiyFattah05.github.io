            <h2>About Us</h2>

            <p>
                The Palestinian Cultural Organization (PCO) is a student-led initiative at UNC Charlotte,
                founded and driven by a passionate team of nine students dedicated to representing Palestine
                on campus. Known simply as PCO, our mission is to celebrate and preserve Palestinian culture
                by sharing who we are as a people — our traditions, our art, our resilience, and our joy —
                with the broader university community.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our work goes beyond cultural expression. We strive to keep the Palestinian spirit alive on
                campus by hosting events that educate, inspire, and unite people from all backgrounds in
                solidarity and understanding. From September through April, we proudly organize weekly events,
                creating consistent opportunities for engagement and growth. Many of these gatherings have
                drawn crowds of up to 300 attendees, reflecting the growing interest and support for our
                mission.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over the past year, our efforts have also extended into humanitarian impact. Through our
                events and initiatives, we have successfully raised more than $10,000 in support of
                charitable organizations such as <strong>HEAL Palestine</strong>,
                <strong>Muslim Aid Society</strong>, <strong>Palestine Aid Society</strong>, and the
                <strong>Palestine Children’s Relief Fund (PCRF)</strong>. Each dollar raised and each event
                hosted reflects our unwavering commitment to amplifying Palestinian voices, culture, and
                compassion here at UNC Charlotte.
            </p>

            <p>
                At PCO, we believe that cultural pride and community service are deeply intertwined — and
                through both, we are ensuring that the Palestinian blood continues to run strong on campus.
